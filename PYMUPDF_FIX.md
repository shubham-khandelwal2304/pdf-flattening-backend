# PyMuPDF Build Fix for Render

## The Problem
PyMuPDF 1.23.14 fails to compile on Render due to C++ compilation errors in the MuPDF library.

## Solutions (Try in Order)

### Solution 1: Use Older PyMuPDF Version ✅
**Current fix**: Using PyMuPDF 1.23.5 which has better pre-compiled wheels.

### Solution 2: Alternative PDF Library
If PyMuPDF still fails, we can use an alternative approach:

```python
# Replace PyMuPDF with pdf2image + Pillow
import pdf2image
from PIL import Image
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter
```

### Solution 3: Use Pre-compiled Wheels
Add to requirements.txt:
```
--find-links https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
PyMuPDF==1.23.5
```

### Solution 4: Build with System Dependencies
Add build.sh script (already created) and use:
- Build Command: `chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh`

## Current Status
✅ **Fixed**: Updated to PyMuPDF 1.23.5
✅ **Added**: .python-version file
✅ **Added**: Alternative requirements
✅ **Added**: Build script

## Next Steps
1. **Try deploying again** with PyMuPDF 1.23.5
2. **If still fails**, we'll implement the alternative PDF library approach
3. **Monitor build logs** for any remaining issues

## Alternative Implementation (If Needed)
If PyMuPDF continues to fail, I can rewrite the PDF processing using:
- `pdf2image` for PDF to image conversion
- `Pillow` for image processing
- `reportlab` for PDF creation

This approach is more cloud-friendly and doesn't require complex C++ compilation.
